# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game (Player Vs CPU)

This is our most memorable 1v1 childhood game with a little twist.
The user plays against the CPU.

The code calculates the best move every time it's the CPU's chance.
Thus, making it impossible for the CPU to lose.
The best you can do is end up with a draw.

The best chance is calculated using backtracking and the code is written in C++.
